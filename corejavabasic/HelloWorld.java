 do-while:
1.add do-while in all switch case programs
2.Accept a number from user and check(with do-while)
		1.whether it is even or odd
		2.whether it is +ve,-ve or zero
		3.whether it is palindrome number or not
tasks outside of a comfort zone require more persistence because they are harder but will get easier over time.
		4.whether it is armstrong number or not
●	There are three levels of comfort:  Comfort Zone, Edge of Comfort Zone and Outside the Comfort Zone.
●	Persistence is required for something at the edge and outside of a comfort zone because it is often difficult.
●	Challenging tasks become easier over time.
○	Comfort Zone: This circle represents your comfort zone. These are the things you know you are good at and feel confident about. You rarely fail when you do any of these things. 
○	Edge of your Comfort Zone: This represents the edge of your comfort zone. These are the things that you mostly know how to do and you feel comfortable practicing. But sometimes you still make mistakes..
○	Outside your Comfort Zone: This represents the area completely outside of your comfort zone. These are the things you do not know how to do and do not feel comfortable doing. These may even be things you don’t enjoy doing.
